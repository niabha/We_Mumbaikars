<h1>Mumbai Metro</h1>
<br>
<hr>
Mumbai metro was designed in order to make life of a mumbaikar easy when it comes to transit.

An average Mumbaikar spends atleast 2 hours per day travelling and that's the reason why we needed fast and efficent routes.  

That's the whole point why Mumbai Metro came into existance. 

The map below displays every detail related to Mumbai Metro. 

You can select views from the map to see the routes and stations that are present as of now in order to access Mumbai Metro.

We have also incorporated the Plans which include stations and routes of the Metro which is yet to be built.
